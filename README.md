## Abstract
To state the obvious, the NFL is a quarterback-centric league. Quarterbacks are the heart of a football team and lead the offense, more often than not dictating their teamâ€™s performance. With that being said, how important is the QB position really for winning a Super Bowl? Quarterback is far and away the highest-paid position in football: superstar quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes (10 years, $450 million) and Deshaun Watson (5 years, $230 million) have received massive long-term extensions, while mid-level quarterbacks like Daniel Jones (4 years, $160 million), Geno Smith (3 years, $75 million), and Jimmy Garoppolo (3 years, $72.75 million) have recently cashed in big. Quarterbacks from Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes to Trent Dilfer and Nick Foles have all won Super Bowls, so is paying this absurd amount of money for a quarterback necessary for winning a Super Bowl?
